You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably a child for kids, you know in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can put it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has been elected a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell down somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle of the middle in the middle school, in <unk> to Ohio where I was the strange class.
When I went down to bleeding every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me get into the bathroom of the teachers.
He made it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm glad that adults never get to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio, and please bring that man to that man who I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to get away with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we get away from her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, the circle had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what I was in front of me.
And I <unk> them up to me, almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when we get out of the glaciers or <unk> the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give me and hold it up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated by themselves, as we look at us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing an ancestral atmosphere.
As you melt a iceberg as an iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if I was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is more than 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's gradually going to come up to actually see a eardrum <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg in Greenland, which is average.
<unk> water from about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows one different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment -- a baby. <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception.
Think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm put together the X chromosome <unk>
And in the other case, the chromosome X chromosome is put together with the X chromosome <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground that would be two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy -- -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy the social norms.
I've been working for example, with twins identical <unk> two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex and individuals whose physics would not fit into male male and natural <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
And it takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having sex that are not <unk> in male common forms or <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we have <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a <unk> course in the <unk>
When you get the baby, the baby looks like a girl.
It's a young girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing up and developing breast institutions, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> it actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called the areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman knows not the <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman most of women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way, can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just discovered that he had eco-friendly and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it had the chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that they essentially created a male object.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component of typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was to age 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why children with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> they are <unk> it is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are tested on various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity that is going to be a black man means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside one body.
The highest case is last year it's last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What test they are going to do to determine whether to figure out whether you're <unk> it's man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these categories were <unk> categories were <unk> <unk> categories that would be used directly into <unk> categories are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology of the river.
As we see, we go into the rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the <unk> of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved into science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a lot, they got a pen in front of the nose and it moves still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, to extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, by people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
It turns out that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
It was from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, I find each other and watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radically and beautiful and held for 200 years.
And as you remember, what we were <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept, of anatomy.
The old monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was coming into political power by the blood of the blood from the <unk> to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They brought in the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was very radical.
And in part of it, they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were being collected two things.
And I was <unk> democracy and at the same time to science science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be able to be <unk> transmitted by the idea of a vague <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of nuclear, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were <unk>
And then the success of the Civil Rights movement was used with people of <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people in color than <unk> at <unk> <unk> on the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking ourselves, why do we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish, the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should have <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five years was allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense of it.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, Mary, was three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, the other hand, was born in term: was born March March in 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right consent of sex consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the legal <unk> to Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on his hand, does not have the same rights rights that was Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science came so much in the field of the anatomy we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
So for example: Texas at a certain time has decided to marry a man doesn't have to have <unk> and to marry a woman is to have y <unk>
Now, in practice they do not test tests to people.
But this is also very strange to given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I would "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people -- not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks too <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for human rights -- because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sex relationships that people than I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content in <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of one person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to drive this current thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless you're willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that had made a couple of years ago to give birth twins and then pick them up, and so he <unk> his <unk>
But when the phone is asked by the course of the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, said to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be those who are not <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be about democracy, or as it might have been, if we had more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking of groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about research studies is that women on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and engage with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is no female <unk>
But the more I've thought about her question, the more I think there is some feminine in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the women's brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very aware of them, to find the way to protect people in the state of state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we have to explore democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect life, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go and live and work, has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for new residents.
Well, right now, we are far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than its building cost.
So we could easily reach out to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound to you, if you never thought about new cities.
But it just replaced it from apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners and the other half still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make expansion in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we're going to do, is that those buildings and areas that surround them have policies to avoid the <unk> and the resource costs.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, build a whole new apartments building and whenever the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting it up.
So I suggested that governments are bringing new systems of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the reform challenge.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> to go out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following regular elections, <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform in which a reforms promised and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
In the meantime, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and install all the residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, we met in a conference room for a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about the valuable thing about what cities are, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, <unk> in some cases, worth billions of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, then said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms than a <unk> city is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a charter that will <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 miles.
So I was trying to convince you to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed up the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to North Carolina.
And we also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Afghan government, would need help of <unk> countries they would benefit from the countries associated with them and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the charter effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily <unk>
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to take the Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that could create these special special regions.
In a country that had just passed through this crisis, <unk> voting in Congress in favor of this Chinese constitutional crisis.
All of the parties, all the <unk> all <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
February 17, passed another time in a voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the 21st of the 21st to 24, a <unk> shifting <unk> went to two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second town.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and to allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country already has committed to allowing their Supreme Court to be the court ultimately for this new justice system.
There are <unk> and <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go get a job, sometimes mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about thinking about to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside the inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- which is that I live with the <unk>
I love to find, by wearing and more recently, photograph and publish my blog, colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go and meet people who are usually going to know about my money goes to a good <unk> and my way is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
Am I going <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would take for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes inside and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I wanted to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman who walks for TED in <unk> --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting.
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including <unk> cost me, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible -- impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, not just <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember the <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you're not good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week, just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave some things back.
I don't need to teach these things, because back around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and I look at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left-hand side is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the evolution of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a great demonstrated in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need pretty much logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need very intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put in play with them and then we see as a <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed the next time that it says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in parking space he taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist -- because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was a physics that was a few years ago; you would need to need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also didn't be touched by my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be the principles of quantum <unk>
I can't find the reason why it should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a small computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big look at the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> a springboard a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> swimming on the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up with me to do those things, because I don't want to piss it to you or actually <unk>
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then we introduced a <unk> and pulled all the air, and then they put it at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measured its movements.
We found that it ran in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. and the way he <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when you give him a smooth pie, we could make it <unk> and you could not take it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing we would do, and they didn't get at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving over and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, watch this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you work your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, that seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about it that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to a museums and art to my head who is here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were discussing with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explained by just this slide -- and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've carried on from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around every museum that there are.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get stuck.
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the hall,
continue to go forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion <unk>
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get from 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in all around you very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I walked into and I found that the kids were actually playing something together.
So I did a little bit of a little bit, talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to even further depth and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to take you up the image, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we've just done a zooming around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things, send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, it also doesn't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to its artwork that is represented properly online.
And the big question I do today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, early children in Italy are growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is something really interesting in <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a <unk> one, you take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you get the career.
This is what I mean, in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
So what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics and electronics alone.
They're becoming computers in the free air.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As one note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumer consumption, and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms that were <unk> and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> non <unk> And so what did not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and actually push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with luck of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now what happened that day is looking at the <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the early afternoon, there are people here and doing call call <unk>
It starts with silence.
<unk> in France.
You know, people do a quick call go to the bathroom.
Second time, End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk>
There you see the great peak.
The next day they were to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume it.
Today we know all about the background of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how are you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little over a year than a year to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't are still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we run one day still follows there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change from behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about sensing and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is actually pushing on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city who came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of the water use in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop -- it was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And then you get a commission to design the gate of the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There are no doors and no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone else was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture disappears.
Here it is running.
You see people <unk> by what's going on.
And here I'm myself trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All of the children of <unk> came to the building because the way that they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to you, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump into not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think of using people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have a little helicopter in the air, and you have a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration.
Or just in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get anywhere and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of best ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements, and use it as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
That's so much 3D digitization in real time like motion capture.
It can take the whole movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry to the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will tell us, we can go from the digital world, in the power of <unk>
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address challenge today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do we go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be sharing the main moments of the main Olympics, even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new <unk> of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only about changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> by more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, it's stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure by themselves?
What about more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it most about them?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had to be the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here in the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that besides <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for light of <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the one that interests you.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machine of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> of that <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry into the more bacteria gut than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that you can want no effort to get their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> to the output.
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like only one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've been <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that are just just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to two daughters.
But when those organisms show up, things start to change.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, one could say that the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, they <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in his 90 years.
And one night he hits his door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a beautiful dancing dancer in clothes.
He looks at it and says, <unk> it for a <unk> <unk>
"It is right." He says, "I pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to make us healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted it to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about changing the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of an evolutionary view, you and I are kind of rocket rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let me go to the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality for my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily benefit the greatest or the stronger or the faster, and even the most smart one.
Evolution encourages the best creatures to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish reported to the empty, however, have managed to do that an <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the stage, I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the <unk> reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and wiped out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we would get to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, they <unk> <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen in evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of natural <unk> dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would suggest that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when it was <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and scary choice.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes for individual and family level.
You also think that if it could be possible to be able to not only be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Would you want to do those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could get the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to cost about 20,000 and a week.
They didn't get a lot to get the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more to all of us.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but are going to involve <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine, which is grown in cells in a plant plant.
Can you imagine a good thing to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two other little <unk>
They can change cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they were able to change sperm and <unk> them or change the <unk> egg -- and give their children a better chance of a better life, to remove the diabetes to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same kind of same technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of hand this to the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could be 100 thousand years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren in their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to pick different different attributes that we want for some of us but not to the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and <unk> the wisdom to make these things <unk>
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flying.
So immediately, they looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would pick up the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without noises.
And then he said three words.
The three most <unk> words I have heard.
He said, "Go for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
I was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to address all the experiences I have wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is ready -- I'm going to put it up.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I took the bridge George Washington bridge -- which was not a lot of -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I tried to do all of what I did.
But I can also give rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that you get on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
You feel about <unk>
I'm not trying to be <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I grew up, I had the feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness was <unk> in a single thought, which is, I want one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
And at that point I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And I was <unk> another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does their relationships change and negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they are being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, you have a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, and so obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how are they communicating <unk>
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can I be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that I wrote a check that I had no idea of how I was going to <unk>
I got married with his brother and his father there at that very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on that and recorded negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> attacks and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a life cycle of life in their <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we get a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is I call it <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy gets an email from him, and you say, "Not <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> <unk>
My wife, kids and I, we moved into the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken off the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went into the <unk> tour, my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> Sun that we bought in the <unk> <unk> ride some copper wire and things from Stanford <unk> and <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one, we published the code, we published the software for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, <unk>
There is no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person's room and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> for the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of computer boards from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot so that we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he would say, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I would have been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could get a <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> center at the center of Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to all do every day when we find something that you feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who am I <unk>
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years in which we are generally very difficult and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
Out of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat just this -- fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been focusing on a lot of <unk> situations with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that we do -- <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that would be seen entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk in which you have no idea what it is, and according to content I could call it in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But I said, this is a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I would not have heard that for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could have been able to be able to engage them for something as difficult or as dangerous as walking into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film which is about the <unk> of product and marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom, at beginning to end, has some brand images all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the brand two.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the brand of X brand in the title degree, but we're going to make sure that we made all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe we would take a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've got.
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever was ever <unk> the best drink -- you know, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is also to show the brands as part of life, make them that <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea -- all the shot -- beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
And yet, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big markings on a couple of big ways.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> the film or to be me?
JK: So, two things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of a microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the <unk> concept was to present to as many people as possible, to make people as well as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the whole media -- is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a mistake that you know, and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were made.
I like your <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> simulation of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk> -- like that weird bear that's still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's pretty risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want them to have a story, but we want to have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is him looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond -- and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go on the middle of my own, I would have to take off the middle of my own team.
So what I started to figure out about suddenly -- and I started to give myself a lot of me -- is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, enormous, giant giants and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who do Hollywood big, giant Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful because the brands are associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get to you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then I would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for a man to make it strong, solid, <unk> <unk> as it is.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
We put into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we're rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have some other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests you.
MS: How words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
KF: That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category on positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool longer?
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the street, people like me, the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: reviving the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I wear accessories like sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In a <unk> part of you -- partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of <unk>
They put toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I often broke myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which you look around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work that you do.
All of those things came from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one, this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things -- I like weird things.
A: Tell me how to do that?
What's the <unk> What phase is you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your heart. Big <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> makes it <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
<unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some businesses are only being focused on one of their strong points, or in the other rather than to focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the absolute nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid fear, those elements and you actually make it sort of become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is Apple Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands all of those things that have gone and come and have a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to get your personal identity, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a <unk> attribute of it.
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as it is playful like <unk> and <unk> <unk> or bold or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more <unk> attribute of <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
Are you reliable, stable, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise mine like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
And so they allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story about this film -- how this film is now using MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain as much for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to St. Paulo where advertising in the free air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been successful are the ones that I've been doing, with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? <unk> <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies we're talking about with their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train their employees in loss <unk> they're preparing their whole company to be preparing their own company to be making it from rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to give rise to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> fear.
From a <unk> at a time, we need to hug risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today more than never a little honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends in <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I'm going to tell you in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my family for TED year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we had to put a cash virus from Windows on a laptop that was used by an engineer to set up this gray box, so we are ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started investigating six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part -- the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed like wanting to do something with these <unk> boxes these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> were <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> he wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working on that place: <unk>
If it doesn't, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big deal.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They are all points to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15 billion code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to communicate it with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about recipients of recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> <unk> and it's surely in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They are not found several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and asked them into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part in the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the attack goal was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to nest <unk> so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> number is <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had with our hands.
And so there's no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken by several weeks of hard work.
We were going to go down dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> were used to one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we have given what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are going to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There's the gray box, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> <unk> values from sensors for example, from the sensors of pressure and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber.
It's cool.
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not perform fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes down, you have to open escape tubes.
Obviously, this can't do a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it may be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a street factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It makes the most possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we begin to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public done in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the major aspect of this thing.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give <unk> skills or another one that makes you a wheelchair come up and get back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that is put in the morning, gives you a great force that is in addition to its speed, and I help her, for example, driving the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other kinds of things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injury in the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to back.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can rotate 90 pounds for variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of wheelchair users about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people roughly, in <unk> across the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens frequently, very young people with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets older quickly.
Your only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, since their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> who is using Amanda <unk> who makes 19 years ago he had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals on the computer on board right here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give engines to the engines in the <unk> and in the knees, and they do it to this very natural <unk>
I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never get back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
I stole to the last hint of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it is down in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just about soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of the wheelchair, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> Bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimps, their closest living relatives
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too focused on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest, and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and hunting and deforestation do that you can't fill up a stadium with the bonobos in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear a little bit of a hidden laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the ape <unk> the love, the <unk> not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity given that <unk> life is more than <unk>
<unk> as humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to set bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and a human ritual
The game is the glue that comes to us.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos that are just taken off the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't speak football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as well as human in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we have this video that's really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to say -- this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a kind of <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
In order to adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get the most of our ability to have this game?
The game is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate play play, you can be the most <unk>
So fellow primates, accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, it fires as a captain assistant in a fire body of volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are saving a highly skilled staff -- one has to get to the fire site in action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain to get to the captain and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came to the captain first to the captain and he asked her to go into the dog's owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money, which, for the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people that I walked into a building in fire to save a live to be just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between at home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was going on the stairs, at the end of the hall I went to the fire firemen that went on to that height or less they had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house <unk> her home for home where, as she was expected, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> house -- because of the brave effort he proved to save his home.
The kindness that she was observed by the other thing was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as king, volunteer fireman is witness acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or they are at the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get now.
They were eating food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have a chance to save someone's life, but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So go into the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, <unk> modules in a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> you came up with this.
It was called itself.
And in a few years, the brick bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete the <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks that would take about each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex, one brick at once.
But there is a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of the engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is come together by magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange of the orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue together with a green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or more slow down, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growth collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to go into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, <unk> <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given to the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day they don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night work, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers, no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an <unk> barrel of motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is made of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all of us.
So you have open source data.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for to get involved with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit into <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I would have the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> for <unk> and would be like some <unk> of Peace <unk>
We had some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears to be if I would look for a quote, but what really looks for is that someone is going to clean up when it gets caught up by the snow because he knows it's not very good when he was throwing fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that the citizens got together with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you are."
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it goes viral.
One responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it -- not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> <unk> but people stealing their batteries.
So it asks citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just came up to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
And software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they made the normal channels would have taken at least two and side about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the head of California that even the time has moved to two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shot from warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the better ways of working -- not as in private businesses as many people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
That is, without <unk> in a open and <unk> form.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the government of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of <unk> institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to apps were every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone don't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick up people so that they were <unk>
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly of <unk>
This is the center of telephone care and information.
It's the place that the calls calls if you mark <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a mobile and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New <unk> Boston <unk>
One day, this happened really, actually comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make a <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I'm approaching the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income in the government to <unk> collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to engage and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had an important role.
I connected two people.
And it could have connected them to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better and cheapest alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
So how many times have we picked a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will take our values and reflect our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of 15 feet.
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of <unk>
But it's that <unk> which keeps that <unk> that belongs to us that we evolved as something that we are against, that other thing, and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy to be <unk>
Because that's where the real job is happening.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request from <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- is <unk>
And for those of us who have been obsessed with government, it's time to ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really think that we will go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible that technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not that hard to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old so I am, so I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express their opinions at any way at the same time and they do.
That's why when the government problem is not really important to do their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set up the work to program applications that make it work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking a garbage <unk> dumping a garbage cube in it.
And of course, we could always have <unk> those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone there, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us together, we're going to be a crowd of voices, or also we're going to be a crowd of your hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a true honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in community communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED and watching these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't have learned this in law practice, my job.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in a whole conversation in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way he looked at the world.
She was hard -- but it was also <unk>
When I was small and watching her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so excited that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would come up to <unk> and I was approaching me, and I would still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I was <unk> again and if I said yes, I left her in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish you to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, walked through the room, and she took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and told me, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now he said, "Now you know, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just do I want you to get three things -- <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to be <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
Then he said, "What the second thing I want you to do, is that you always are going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do."
And then finally, he said, "What I want you to tell me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I am going to do that.
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14  15, my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
And we just get the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, "We are doing the <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I went down the face of the force and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the other ones that they don't really see it.
We can't get them to do things that don't think that we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of the three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore County, Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all young color children are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is really much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results of the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The policy of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems with ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at in our work some of these developments well curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to voting.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before they have the law of the right to voting.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without possibility to go out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
I would encourage people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by error.
Out of nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent who is innocent and liberated from the death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent of every B.
This is interesting.
In aviation wouldn't it would be allowed to ever fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we would get away from the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue that we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot of this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was an defined little bit of terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined its lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you talk about it, he says, "Mr. Stevenson, you do <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our own story, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously done with <unk> and decades of <unk> race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had to do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people who could not overcome race development without a truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany performing death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> we don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, though, and yet, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of these things.
Today, we talked about the need to have more hope, the more engagement, the more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> those who will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that's inside of our self.
It's really that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With creativity, development comes not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the U.N.
This life connection with heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation in the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, you have to <unk>
There is no disconnect to technology and design, which allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality of injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women would just gather to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I know <unk>
And then she would say, "Well, what do you do when you are."
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom hanging out for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and when I ended up and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> really <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> put me my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't care about it, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not that a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, because of our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich and powerful ones, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot force.
They were tired, tired, people like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> customers and 14 years, who have been rewarded for adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge would take him as an adult, but I see a child.
One night a very late night was wake up with God, if the judge can become something that you are, it must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old customer -- a poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black client for 14 years to be treated as a <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, I had not only been <unk> but he had sent it to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car. Get me to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met the stairs when I found a black man who was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
And then I got sick and <unk>
And I'm going to tell you in the ear, in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I was me." And we started argumentation.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I noticed the <unk> which was going and <unk>
He looked out the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
You walk down here and get there.
Finally, this old black black, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, "What do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, "We would go to this young audiences to tell this young man who keeps her sight in the target with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we cannot truly be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see a clear sense of the audience, in this community, to help in your way to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's several opportunities near you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which an effort is going to make the funding that you spend today in corporate gas today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty over the next five years.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of <unk> don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up with these funds to make the law law, to security.
I think there's a very familiar opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that you have to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think this is?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a chain to bring people out to supply a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for me to come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- it could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single day of each day, our senses are actually getting so much more data than the brain can <unk>
And as nothing really matters to survive, the first stop of all this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning -- the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories <unk> to look at the negative ones.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because all the digital devices give us negative news every week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe enormous progress that was done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good themes -- climate change, the extinction of species, the shortage of water, no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we ended up with them.
Let's look at the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life is more than <unk> average income per capita income is <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has gone down 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenny that the world literacy went from 25 to more than 80 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to save them every time.
In fact, we have the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and then over its exponential growth.
And my good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put into technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and <unk> at the war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the cycle of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and <unk> and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and to distribute personalized production all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and food and food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I.
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this -- this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, there would be <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops would eat with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum of something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
You know, this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 energy energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about dancers but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than produced by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's now talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft, Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, later <unk>
It was a famous picture, how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but also there is hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator, <unk>
It's able to make a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source source, saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this is what you're going to be, Coca-Cola will be in the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an innovation driven by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications communications than President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And having a smart smartphone with Google, they have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton is 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology, and they are now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best way to get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because they have <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where <unk> charge is about 25 percent, and there is health care workers.
When this device <unk> a <unk> or DNA virus, which is not going to be able to call the health care and, first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk> billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What wishes of <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of using impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can give us three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk> and <unk>
What about a few voices never before.
What if we give the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and to be able to act for the first time?
What would these three billion billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't afford to.
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams, guided by their passion with an objective of course, they can do things that could do things that could only do great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the groundbreaking of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do.
We are in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very controversial idea.
It's about <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you have three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that's nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
Second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, <unk>
There was about 20 degrees, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so they got over the middle of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I went back to five centimeters.
It is a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat.
I went out to go fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were coral, other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny blobs of <unk> of the remains of coral reefs.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is really fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishery begins.
The background is going to be a solid coral backdrop in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We had once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area that have never been fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
You know, the starting point of starting at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
In the <unk> we have a lot of <unk> biodiversity, how many whales, the world's water supply.
And that changes over time, it changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the vulnerability of changes.
And at the end of keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or not what they were gone.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
With time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of you would have a little bit about a captain of a little bit of fish in this area can't be used or, generally they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, they were really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been running and very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine protected area can benefit from the vision that would be able to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the Middle West people in the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay Bay ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> Why do we <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, it has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> to make <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today, you'll see why the videos are made <unk> and what difference has that.
We all want to be <unk>
But today's video today makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And, of those, just a small percentage of it is actually getting lots and lots of <unk> visits and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the views of the rise of popularity last summer.
I didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this claim that <unk> the video to the <unk>
The trends like Jimmy <unk> presented us with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a larger public public.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, and you have to start on the end of a week, the weekend.
<unk> from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have arisen out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday, <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a more long, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
So unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation, with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours version that has been seen four million times.
And the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that watched other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet Internet community.
There were <unk>
Somebody did an old version.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly it came a whole community of collapses that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can be <unk>
Because today I don't just want to make them <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could you have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video comes up with a minute, just that really unique thing can be done by the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really interested me.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular for <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you properly successfully by the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for everything that we do in creative form.
And all this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The tendency, creative communities, creative communities, fully unexpected, are features of a new kind of culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't want permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, just like the media today, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom in his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, my <unk>
<unk> in silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother allowed me to forget his story.
My job was to not let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
And the next part of the puzzle is on a boat at the dawn <unk> rising towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was so only 18 years old when his father died, and marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat was slid to the sea <unk> of ship vessel.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was pirate and death.
Like most of the adults my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were <unk> first of us we'd take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> <unk> into each wave, and the horizon and vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and killed the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations across the way to a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class class -- whose existence I had <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were traded between the people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra mentoring in English and math -- wouldn't matter, what was supposed to be <unk> which is usually <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, what?
Something in me is <unk>
I was <unk> determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would go on in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were telling us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares are in order to be able to get it out.
She opened a computer shop, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and boys were caught between two worlds.
They looked subsidies and <unk>
They created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student -- relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lifetimes tragically they fought by violence, substance abuse and isolation.
But a lot of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected by the average Australian young Australian man.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
As a <unk> resident from <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the arts and the comfort of the life in a suburb to <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did it for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
He hadn't ever been an option.
He said, "and you can't be the <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> at <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly talk, the more it was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, so many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career issue.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new arrived at the scene -- and not only is okay, but it's something that is what you're going to be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside of my comfort place to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism.
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people who <unk> slogan was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, I was making a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
It was going to be good at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we open up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
And then one trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and it will take a lot more <unk> it caused when I won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
He was in the shower in the fourth hotel room at <unk> when she was killed 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell ourselves stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
He asked her to <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life we built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have gone easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to do it?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a <unk> on each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and watch it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is right now in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and they drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when we <unk> the great Prince ethnic warrior was <unk> he was <unk> and he was <unk> and with a <unk> on the ground, she can get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I got a lot of fun.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would get my idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow magic, not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me her pocket.
And this <unk> piece was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that the mobile phone, the luxury <unk> and the cameras prevent them to go.
We make our inspiration <unk>
And so I told me, I was brought to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of her.
I read books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book, you know?
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation, the sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But why is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My little girl inside of all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we're talking about children.
For some reason, the fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to unlock the fireflies.
And they actually light your way into the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I would go into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In any fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
I'm going to come in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and wet book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's child history.
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason why children are not doing it.
So in order to get this childhood ritual that we have to go out and go out of a chapter, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is actually creating a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and on and on and through an augmented reality, it sees a group of cartoons that appear on inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves it.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be <unk> with technology and magic and technology are closer to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listen to listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that we all are, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> are fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It's got a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I would tell you.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got a challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get involved -- sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem problem is not at the same time that I need assistance to <unk> or some urgency of that style -- it was just looking back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, to take their <unk> pressure on their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, go back to <unk> control and to be <unk> of their own <unk> but it can also help us care because of the challenges we face, as the head of the costs of attention, <unk> demand and other issues.
And the techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have <unk> controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have it in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are in <unk>
But where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience to look at a <unk> please see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up at <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and the weeks next to the next weeks of Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we wish that we were global <unk>
We're putting all the colleagues in the world, at some universities, to help us to find work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us to verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in their place.
Please go through this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was aroused by my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because of using the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
It was like this one: a building on a very small road here.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common target of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
You know, they will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more than to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem true.
Are the details or the <unk>
Do you ask light?
What is it that it creates the <unk>
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world, and how can you perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic about what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly occurring objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in a certain way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It's really in combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic -- I think they're those in which they don't even recognize the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But when we combine these photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they took the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect creature.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
<unk> are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a cut in stone.
And yes, I even had a red house at the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and rather <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
So if you can do it."
It's a diagram anybody who took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm talking about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here is something that happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why is it going to look at the technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve that you say, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to take on the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It's not very much.
But if you would say, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> shift.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves that we see they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will be turned into a typical curve -- I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
That is, now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, "What is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale where I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So we go back over a half a half billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals coming around them.
If you look at the way those chemicals organized the chemicals we give up an idea of how things happened.
And I think there is theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was a very simple version of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil sticks with a particular combination of chemicals that were made up to incorporate materials from the outside and so those blobs grew up together.
And they started divide.
In some sense, those were the most intractable cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe in chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals.
So every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow become better than being better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> they grew more, and more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things are interesting to be interesting when these drops to the <unk> they learned the <unk> trick.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell into a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution of evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> from white dust that I'm trying to hide at security security.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if anybody wants 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have been shot by the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years ago.
But then there was another big step in which things are very different, and that was that these cells started exchange and communicating information forming that cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
In that way, for example, evolving resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way they were avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to that communities that were going to be together in a way, and they set up a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> more and were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were so close to that in fact, they came together and they decided to write all the recipe from the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that have communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't work yet.
The skin cell doesn't serve without your heart, or your muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than your cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
And they started pouring information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not in the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had been built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit out.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information that has been enormously <unk>
Because evolution might now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea -- vague and <unk> in their heads that holds a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated to convert it into sound, in sound, of sound, and we make something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to make <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods of similar periods of <unk> <unk> our record methods presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> computer tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we would do before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that told them it takes a billion years ago.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the beyond, like the electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that leverages its own pace of change.
The more it does, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to focus on a very conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction -- we put it on the machine and the machine that does something that you did not even could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these fancy instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to command numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to two of the numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But once one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences they did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we will argue that the best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will take the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Put it again.
We had some mutations <unk>
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are completely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to figure out how they work.
These are dark lights.
But do you get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that we get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives rely on to do it.
Once I was on a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulled out a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I got stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up a part of my false status on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> the <unk> talk about statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard about it.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> than 200 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game without being <unk> and anyone who tried to deal with the first base, not coming to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the <unk> of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> in a regular season of <unk>
Now I will argue this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable and maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a record for 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear guy has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derives to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's actually getting better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But they will tell you.
What do you think it should be the average of hits a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> to the world, and I include me with being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I found when I was in medical school.
I was an obsessional <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood tests.
Such well.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nursing home of the General in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, the origin and the <unk> labor and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> is frequent differential and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis on how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very fine; I graduated with <unk>
And I read from the school of medicine with the impression that if I did everything, I would know everything, or as possible, close to everything -- because I think about mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency room where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to go back to a cardiologist I was going to come to that patient to me.
It will inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a sound <unk> on both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood going into your lungs, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him <unk> pills of water, so I could get rid of liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I don't raised the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, he would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
And maybe I didn't want to be a resident who is constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even playing my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send him home, I didn't take a voice on my inner voice that said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, it was so sure that I was asked to the nurse who would take the lady <unk> <unk> who is okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the tall, <unk> the ambulance together with the <unk> they brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went down to quit the hospital, and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, ...
I went through the emergency room on the way home.
And there another nurse, not the one who was <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors had been <unk>
Other specialists fear it as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients.
The three words are, remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the brink of death.
In an hour of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a <unk> and his family called the <unk> the <unk> they brought them into the emergency room with a blood pressure from 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock to severe.
I could barely breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff will spread all its resources.
They gave you medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in critical therapy and he was waiting for all of the hope that they would get.
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And at 8 or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
Over the next few weeks, I was upset about it, and I experienced the shame shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> shame I'm talking about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was it wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take things and make sure that I didn't get sick.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Gradually, that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were to choose the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, would do stops those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, he was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man 25 years old with an pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her because he was a little bit <unk>
I was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my chief asked to talk to me about her in his office.
And I made the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by an pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but it's going to have the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by going <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they had 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a mathematical calculation of it.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and called the surgeon the surgeon.
The other patient was so much of diarrhea.
I read liquid command for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and notice some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on and recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this to not make the same <unk>
If I go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, they don't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> my wrong leg, believe me, he would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones that they can't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we have the idea of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal <unk> medical study and medical errors for learning how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Star to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work on a system where errors are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are messed up, or the <unk> is not right -- in a system where HIV infection are increasingly more and more <unk> for chaos and death.
In this country, those are killed by 24,000 Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is going down every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, come up with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and suddenly my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, not to get one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's a custom a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> -- this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students refused to go down and go down the head and pour saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context to be able to do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and they know it, and they don't be proud of their errors, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way to support it to all of us <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings address the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human <unk>
And I'm a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I still don't know what to me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk> day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick an American American is about 70 a day.
Not a long ago, in a research week followed by a group of business companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks made up of these executives and the time they were going to make decisions related to these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong in the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you fix the way they drive those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to do is choose to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know about your answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, you can raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at the time was very sophisticated at least at the time.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of these <unk> water, and this was when they were water from the <unk>
I loved going to that grocery store, but I was on one occasion, why do I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf oil shelf there.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I was once decided to go to a manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses full of tourists that come every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
pathway.
They had different kinds of classes.
He had a post for <unk> right to the shop.
We put out of six <unk> or from 24 flavors different and we looked at two things: First, what if people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a nine, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
Who stopped when there were 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
Of those who stood when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> probably less good to preserve <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us with good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings,
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, in between a million Americans, in between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> funds available at savings plan retirement, the <unk> program will save people saving for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 options on.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted.
And on the plans that they offered about 60 to funds, the rate of participation went to the 50th <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more of the number of options, more people will be <unk> to avoid actions or investment.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts in the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we were <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, the <unk> even when it goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
You're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they have seen it better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast to that awesome <unk>
Today I want to do with four simple technical techniques that we've made in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in their businesses.
The first is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than now.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, you get to cut, get rid of odd options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales -- the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> we eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> has increased <unk> in <unk> by two largest sales and lower costs.
You know that today's supermarket today offer 45 products.
In a tent there is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the best options is David <unk> the <unk>
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a security fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options itself.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there is between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a little holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave you a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give me a round of <unk> if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept it.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit some more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choices that is <unk>
For people to understand differences among choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very much like very specific <unk>
Why does people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit card than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that you see more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting in which they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting was exactly like <unk> made a little bit <unk>
What we added was that we took the staff to think of the positive things they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway we did.
What we saw is that in the supermarkets, I went through the <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is -- give me a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is -- give me a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
Those categories should tell you something that you might not say that they would be <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge funding.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if only <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision in a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that are offering each other.
I put outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions are going to be.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
What do you think about.
If you have the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that there are a lot of options that go from a lot of options -- <unk> the <unk> button and again and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same piece of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes would not say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building now is more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of a choice of a choice -- to get rid of <unk> alternate alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories at least <unk> <unk>
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more they careful to be in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years, in the East Germany, if you had a <unk> machine I had to get to the government.
I had to register a piece of text from written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they were written with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much it would give us the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer on one page, that page is going to end by having a little yellow dots printed on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them yourself from one and a printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the <unk> city in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online cases, which would take money from your attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media through banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us being a victim of a genuine crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes is online online.
The second group of <unk> which we see today is not really driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, so the protests, they motivate you the opinions, they motivate them to laughter.
<unk> have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the attacks online.
Those are the <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national United States and the <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of preparation of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They made the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
Last week, I asked myself in a meeting with Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people who are going to be <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an Australian authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign foreign authority.
And they were giving <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters in Egypt, the headquarters for the Iraqi secret police -- in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of the country's citizens in the country.
They had this tool for 44,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do that to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It is <unk> Internet connection.
It was even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today, in 2011, any right to live today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has not fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed night, and so soon we would wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to protect it, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and also be angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park, in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, at age nine years old, is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even he helped the lions see the pen away.
I don't love <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they got the second day, and they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to you and turn the lights out.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk>
Let's get everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little <unk> box. I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see it when they come from night.
The lights are going to be <unk> and <unk> to lions so that you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had trouble having the lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them. You can see at the bottom, these are the lights to lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of them.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to frightening other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to grow elephants away.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raising funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a kid in the grasslands, of the savanna savanna cows my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and he said it would someday be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when you go.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other ugly races.
What's the next to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that you have invented electric fences but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I heard it once once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're something big.
We're going to go on every step in every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time by studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Now, sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would happen my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed in a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I was <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we are prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms watching her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> them because they were very concerned about themselves and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea in North Korea.
At the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me, was completely dark, at night except for the sea lights in China, barely across the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves to limit North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans across <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined I would take to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North African refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was beaten up at the police station.
Now somebody had accused me to be <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the interrogation a officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum in <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were now <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans did not have so lucky.
Every year countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to give South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
I went in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South south.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call it with pride of mine.
Although I went to the life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the income exam.
Just when I was starting to join my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were going to have some money I sent to my family, and because my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location of the <unk>
They had to flee away.
I started planning on how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tried for an Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me and I was fortunately believed to me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border border <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated down across the border <unk>
After <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I made everything for free my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was at the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for two North Koreans and get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown, a new hope for me and for the village to be able to do when you get it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
And over time, after our long journey, my family and I sat in South Korea, and we came up in South Korea, from the city.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive by international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> Center for <unk> <unk> food, fast <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Carolina so that it represents something else, so they switched to Los Angeles and South, as if this is going to be really wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a food Desert Los Angeles and home of the food sites to take and eat in the car.
What's curious is that the places of food to carry killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Asia.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair chairs and sold like cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I consider that the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet me.
The point is, belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me on wins, because it is my responsibility and I have to do it.
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest forest forest forest forest -- you know, nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone got <unk>
The city stood up to me, and I just gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made a <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for plant to plant food in a piece of land than anybody else --  And so I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles away from <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant millions of different plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
Let's get a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, he's growing your own food.
You know, your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
As an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, I would <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees and the trees are my <unk> from that canvas.
You get to see what Earth can do, if they let their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool for education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, were like <unk> at night and were in my backyard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people who were so close to hunger, and this only <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at your time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was shared with his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had like about 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be taught if you're not taught how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're caught. I see color guys who are on this path designed for them, which is not going nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who were to be trained from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into your healthy toilet.
I don't care about me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, get kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk> is.
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take a <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you wouldn't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with its <unk> so that we could plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> --  -- probably everybody will agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we have.
And especially if you're going to play on your bicycle and these cars go -- that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy stuff, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a road to quiet in.
The solution for that is to be able to do highways of asphalt roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water flow down to the sides and you will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and we don't waste water to never more.
Noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's too hollow, all the noise <unk> so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface goes through.
First one stone, then more and more and more, and so on, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage comes up in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light -- this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> it <unk> and if they <unk> they will become <unk> and you separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving through the road, you will come up with the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting wool of that to clean up, and we can cut the <unk> of steel in very small bits, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks go back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine of <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried many samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
So we did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and we know them with our <unk> machine and we printed them back to it again.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, and you can even double the life of the ground, you can actually double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how repairability does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC BBC on his little gray radio, little gray.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those days, because the news is usually about it.
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got sick of Afghanistan and made illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I would tell myself as a kid to put my older sister to my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could <unk> them.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could be suspect of where it would be.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us crowded in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would tell her.
But my mother educated <unk>
This is it.
It took him two years ago, only to convert our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there there were moments when I was very frustrated in our life, and she was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to no <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than <unk> and if my family would not have been as committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home by the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He was not just talking about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I carry it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's about what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like my <unk> <unk> for them, even though in front of a foreign opposition.
As a <unk> it's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter was going on from <unk> to her village, and literally, they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his house, you get the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would <unk>
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old daughter and <unk>
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something which is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes don't take a lot after the retirement of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and my parents who are going to go through them, and I see them, I see a future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls of <unk> I would tell you.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But never become a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
It has been almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as a <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call one day of anger and initiate a revolution against the regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50 thousand people -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have asked many other women, to rebuild civil society, rebuild civil society, <unk> a inclusive transition and just toward democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and <unk>
There are about 200 organizations reported in <unk> for and immediately after the <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded <unk> Women <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders of <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right to engage in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that it was <unk> of selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative went and successfully.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, soon as the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day news for violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the murder of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the officers officers do.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the <unk> human rights human rights and lack of respect of law.
Our society, made out of a <unk> mentality to become more, and has gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all, to <unk> with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to tell you that we, as nation, we chose worse, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections don't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society continues to <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating more consensus of what the choices I needed to do, which is just the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the behavioral representation of the most likely to need <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as heroin agents and call a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting it in practice in practice -- instead of revenge. <unk> rather than competition instead of competition as opposed to exclusion.
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to be in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that comes to the interrelationship and the <unk> among female perspectives and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions and has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, from that all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so, like the uterus is completely covers the <unk> growing inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of it.
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is what he is, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That they will all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a wonderful question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence and the question I'm going to address is that everybody is going to be <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk> him.
I am not a psychiatrist, and social worker, no expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I'd moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and an editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man -- that I was creating my alma mater, <unk> me on the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man who loved anybody in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm an English <unk> English University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> or long duration -- or, again, in families, the last place you would want or would expect to find <unk> reason for domestic abuse that is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be used with a man who I would stay with a man who did it and actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, and husbands were killed in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, its warning signals or its patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had a <unk> university from the <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field guy.
He had big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and I loved everything of me, that I was ready to go to Harvard, that he would put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was so that the returns in that <unk> school, and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go out of New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I'd got to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I wanted to quit my work and <unk> and I went back into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was walking into a head in a physical trap physical, financial and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those weapons come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to be feeling so safe and bought in three weapons.
One was in the car.
Another he kept the stick under the pillow on our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those squirt guns to cause the trauma of the trauma that lived in.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those squirt guns actually were a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was serious danger, every minute every day.
The first physical attack <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we lived happily living happily because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
And there was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our sleeping moon <unk> and threw a Big Mac cold to my face.
<unk> followed by one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassment at some point of their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help me tackle his <unk>
The other question everyone else is doing is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we were victims of us, we know something that you typically <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has actually put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other policies include permanent harassment and even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> financial resources, and manipulation of the family care system to protect the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And so we still ask questions why it's just not going?
I was able to go back and go out of one last mile? He beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, the police, my friends and family, the whole unknown unknown, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as chronic headlines -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
A few people is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims of the Arctic victims, deliberately <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> they learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and make their lives joyful and happy lives as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a guy who are cute and kind and <unk>
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get back to you will never, ever be a gun charged with my head on someone who says I want.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid you <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were small or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, to sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad <unk> love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse thrives in silence.
They have the power to end up domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
We need the victims we need around the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light is talking about it with their kids, their peers, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
It would take the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe power.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families and our families in the safe and convince them that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this.  Luckily, I've brought you clothes to <unk>
This is the first job of clothing in a <unk> stage, so you are very lucky -- I think.
And if some of the women are getting <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them away, but it will find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to pass this sweater down the head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would get my back and put her hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or a artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our way we look like, which, shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman in my workforce, and that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but they form <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry of which we are biologically programmed to scale -- we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to take for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> them for how much models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from New York City, I told each and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, were not white <unk>
The next question that people always do is, can it be a model when it's big.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take that.
But then what I would tell you about each one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this list spectacular still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> of American <unk> or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, whether unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once your studies are, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you think is to say, if you did you want to be president of the United States, but you write <unk> Model from inside 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and I was also the first time I had a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering a personal domain, but it was a child.
This is this thing I looked up with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in our V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, and they were <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, let's ask for free?
I have too much about 20 inches and I never use, except the <unk> but the privilege I get -- are the ones I get in the real life, and we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a red <unk> he jumped into red and <unk> and <unk> a Sorry, agent to be able to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for what they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the teenagers who were couple and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
How many times do I get <unk>
When I was looking for this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do to me is, how is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it would be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my every day.
And if you ever say, <unk> <unk> legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most enjoyable legs, the brightest hair and the more in the fashion -- but it's probably the least physically insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will hold from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to the power of the image in the perception we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough to put a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no directors, who had no directors, and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very minimum amount of <unk>
In fact, most of them took them tourists randomly.
My story begins to put in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner of <unk>
He happened to go back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me to go to New York on a <unk> trip and you continue the <unk>
Here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to make us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown unknown, it's so universal.
No one has ever denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred in something sacred for us.
This picture is a couple of weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day was that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time on a week in October and to get us to reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our daughter <unk> new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacting with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking around, when suddenly, it was stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls store that you would put in the previous visits ...
And he described to me what had felt like five years standing in that same place.
<unk> that reminded your heart to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you're looking at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't get out in a lot of family pictures.
I'm always the one that you get the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to sit down to someone and ask him, get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most distressing <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the <unk> press laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly <unk>                  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There's the <unk> of the New World who are largely found in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the Second World -- where we have 16 species -- and of these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are you going to make them important, first of all, they provide ecological services in the first place.
They're our <unk> <unk>
<unk> the carcasses up to bone.
They help killing all the bacteria <unk> they help absorb anthrax that would not be for them would stretch for them and cause huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of bathroom and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk> unit <unk>
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, where six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically critical <unk> <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey on livestock consumption that has been treated with a surgical drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs who are <unk> it has a huge amount of time <unk> and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? OK, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see they travel across different countries, so to focus on a locally locally locally not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we want.
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When out of this room, I will tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion, because he saw them fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It took the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we were playing with is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a lot of Italians decided to teach people in Zambia.
So we got these seeds <unk> in the south of Zambia.
Of course, people were absolutely interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were pretty fertile that local people, in as fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we don't have any of all, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a flying flying into this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> came out from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought only for us the Italians wanted to mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, they were doing -- what they were doing and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It's part of an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
I am trying to do any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want them a lot."
<unk> I deal with everyone in a different culture like my <unk>
That's why white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "It little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have a system just to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never begin anything, you ever trust anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have a dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat in a coffee -- we sat in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, they will tell them, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, which they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go on their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the medical doctor of the company, the family doctor in the business, who sets up with you at your house on your kitchen table in your cafe, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia in India.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this Mediterranean garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can I do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So --   So the government says, <unk> again.  We made it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business members of the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> company.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of corporate spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people who are most passionate about in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to speak with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> are going on mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about you would have done this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurship is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils of <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The engine of internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to think about is how we have <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a journal <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the next year, I gathered up this group of people together, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in a hundred years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not going to be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure of the manure produced six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk> and therefore, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States <unk> <unk> military companies showed up.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few factories that were <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give them a <unk>
In other ways, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute dedicated <unk> service.
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the larger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 hundred companies in the American world -- <unk> Ford -- all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
You know, the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who will ask you, what does it need?
What can you?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." I would look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those are all around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for our cows for the cows that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief to the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always supporting music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful amount of U.S. <unk>
I live near this house, and I thought how I could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also on something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot.
And this caused me a profound gratitude for life and time.
He gave the most significant things of my life today.
But I wanted to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch by day and forget the really important thing to you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this giant house on a giant <unk> I painted on her sentences for <unk> Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die I want to be judged by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit in <unk> in the <unk> line.
Before they die I want to sing for millions of people.
Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
Before they die I want to live out of the <unk>
Before she died, I want to get it once more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me solace in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways -- it's about to accommodate thinking and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and we change ourselves.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of <unk> people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center -- we did a kit and now have gone walls in countries around the world, as Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces, if you give us a chance of express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the things that we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increase, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and so on.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that would become more power.
And when you think about death alone, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very hot.
I don't talk about, but transmitting joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
They share it <unk> what's going to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the skin color.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice on this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to call me the words I don't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: What we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that it must be unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
Do you make the memory more <unk>
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I went out of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I had to pee in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you don't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar term, it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual this is a different way from there that are going to be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there's no known financial <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, watching the washing machine and eat anything that would be <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there has been some hard times in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean you're wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inside, and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please say, I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what should have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, which would give me a communication set of engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of all, <unk> of these students with his great minds, their big books and their big and unknown words.
But when those conversations develop it, I felt what it would have felt when he fell down the hole from the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had those conversations with the students were really surprised that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges, from energy to the environment and care of health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their world wonderful.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and the engineering is attractive.
First question for me, then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones, because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
The jargon is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as stupid as they do.
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies and they are ways to put it together with their content.
And when I present his job, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do? They killed bullets -- they killed their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much supports the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we will take our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they would get.
I think these are just some key things that can help us to open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
There was an editor for the 19th century that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he's looking for a public charge no matter -- platform or <unk> and that, when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and all the politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words of the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted with <unk>
They put her in the <unk> Tower and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, her leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
They wanted to call it the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested of quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given match.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of them -- because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become power.
They wouldn't want to call it King for him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the more <unk> more <unk> and more tragic than it happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't have invented the title. There was already before, but it just meant <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> government, but it was really a trivial degree.
And this is why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take care of a very ridiculous title, and <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't go.
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, hoping that the Senate is in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one of the government says that one of it is <unk> --  -- we may be able to continue to wait for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and this is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story is endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually change it much more the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters in an illegal mine in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk, but most of all, that cacophony of male and male stones with <unk> tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> <unk> light holds to the head with this elastic <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that they hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
And I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met before, who lost control and dropped high feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are at deep in that hole at the risk of their lives without paying a reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never will. Because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the state of Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not as a degree.
When we end up talking to me -- I was pretty bad, I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up with the stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
some, I even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of African Africans during all about slave slaves all the time.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a thousand dollars today today.
However, today you can benefit entire families for generations for <unk> 70 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without payment, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> is almost around the world, and yet, it's illegal in all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk>
<unk> in a quarter of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- they were going to get into a heavy cloak of <unk> coat floating pipes, brick in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day.
There was no enough to eat, not to eat, and the severe <unk> made that pee pretty <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and on and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera receives a lot better than these people.
Back on <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and she trusted him to <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
And in the Himalayas I found children <unk> stones for miles per mile per miles down to trucks who were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children than the charge and the kids would put them into their heads with straps -- made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to do with it.
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this world awareness would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was killed, women who had been previously previously <unk>
It took me a little bit of stairs <unk> that would give this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more of a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known as the craft, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where they are <unk> them with their girls and children, some of us only seven years -- are forced to <unk> clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse their hands of their customers.
<unk> in <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a little bit of a little bit of the stairs where it would be.
There was no doors for me.
There were no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because they play a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people going on in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sexual slaves are sold every year.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families removed in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
And black hands are from the father, the <unk> blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and it dive down into the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me her stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
You still hope, yet you can get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishing family on a boat, two older brothers, some older children, some older kids, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their extended families -- they have been forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to her was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into the lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they got to the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is about the youngest slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working from a single one.

And it will point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi is possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners, the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and the window.
He asked us to push it on a way to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get away from the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed to this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour -- found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they went down to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up in a part, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their back, and as they were looking for gold gold, they were looking for <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a pit in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy stone bags that will then be attached to another area where they put the stone into the power to get the gold.
To first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, the margin is going to be able to be working at least fortunate to children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle he took him to work with him in mines.
As you die of his uncle, <unk> I inherit the debt of the uncle as the force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the 14th mines and the leg of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said that he should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which is a lot of respect.
I want to shine on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that you would give witness to them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about magazines. They are people who are real, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There's not one day that happens to me that I don't think about these many beautiful people -- I have had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in those people like you, and I hope that that force will turn a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we call it, we are like the management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
That's why I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human.
We gave up the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity -- and probably some initial demonstrated that you can have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders as Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a ballet dancer <unk>
Over the last few years, we have made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know whether there really exists a cure when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement has no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> neurologic test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they're never done.
What if the patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the exam to be done.
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is, what I want to do is not conventional for a try, as you can see, in some sense at least, we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it gives sounds to you -- we can imagine as a dance of a <unk> ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the genes needed <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the limbs also affects the <unk>
On the bottom of the bottom you can see a <unk> example of the irregular ropes.
We see the same <unk>
Be a <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurologic test is not <unk> Both the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but the tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something acquires a massive cost is shown by mass scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to address.
We can reduce the labor of the patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With low-frequency monitoring we could get goals.
We could make recruitment <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I will give you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without disease, I can call it under the price of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six hours of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So then you <unk> taking all these samples of, 10,000 people can be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for us -- the factors of confusion in pursuit of the real markers of disease.
TR: They have a precision wave at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to have a fantastic job -- and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which is what the cell phone is -- now we have <unk>
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> gray.
We lie in the dark, in rooms without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the perfect skin we do -- we can get it into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon after later, an organization where I was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit down at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 I traveled to <unk>
It's a small fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the early villages affected by the wave.
The water level has been recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime mud and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We love and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found the similar things.
They found photos and photographs of photos and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
Let's take them and take them to different places in the villages of around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were running out of the wave, and to save her lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, huge <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be in addition to the place of the village where the <unk> center were <unk>
And so they wore it, and I had the honor that this day was <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't even going beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the photos, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook and <unk> with some of them, and the next morning the answer was as overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started tweaking the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be held with very accurately and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as you have the picture of <unk>
With the step of time, they got more photos and they got more <unk> and it was required to go back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
In two weeks, I had 150 people coming from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would send us to <unk> a foreign village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
And the time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much to hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these <unk> photos in the saltwater, covered with algae, with algae, and even oil, and all of it with the time I continue to hear about it, I continue to be a major part of the project.
We couldn't tinker with this picture unless it was clean up, and he would have been replaced by his <unk>
We were lucky enough to <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos anymore.
As once once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had been lucky about the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to destroy the images in a single picture and tinker the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures they shared some of his story with us.
A colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble rather far from where he used to be their house, but their colleagues would take it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their youngest children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took her one week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photos his shorter kid at age 14 years.
For her, even though these pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that would remember the past that wouldn't have been marked by that day in March -- when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up with <unk> and hundreds of them helped us clean up to over <unk> photographs -- the big <unk> -- the great majority came to hands from their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, someone wanted.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing we would look for.
This was about this project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone back to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, to give something, using your talent for something that are not very thin thin skin.
I would like to read this email and I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy the day I went from Japan after six months.
While I was going, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter <unk> our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us with wonder and curious about this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple exhibition just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technical technique that can create videos in slow motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can be seen after the <unk> beyond the line line, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it back into a <unk> second, it is, in a number of <unk> to create a piece of photons of photons just a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in
And that <unk> package that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, one million times faster than a common bullet than a half.
If we take that bullet and this piece of photons and we shoot in this bottle, how do you spread out those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola didn't take this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
And the pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts to show up, and that, inside it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounce inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the <unk> of the top part of the bottle, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and ordinary bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much they think would lead us to see that film?
One day? One day, actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a slow bullet in motion.
And what about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves behind the table, the tomato and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look more and more of this thing, you'll notice that, as the light <unk> of tomato is still bright <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the <unk> light on its inside, and it comes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in his mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to be <unk>
Why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As the photographers, you know, if you take a picture of exposure, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I'll just get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that <unk> package millions of times, and we recorded one and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and sort of interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, invisible, you can get invisible, another heroes.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what it is about to correspond to what it distance.
When you project a laser you can record a laser picture that, you see on the screen, it doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we be able to see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve,
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood, this is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
As <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> data that we collected every time are not just scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see that we can not just get scientific visualization, but we can see.
So to create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and type of colors.
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing as well.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you're going to leave you from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can save life, and they give you individual <unk>
With a mobile phone, a crime is a crime against the Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
You can record a <unk> song, you know, <unk> and <unk>
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would be looking for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these <unk> people who are going to be looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from <unk> have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a <unk>
It's so much a lot. Most of you have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every vendor of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and even two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And in all Europe, people planted up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want to do it in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret Police of East Germany.
And I also asked if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I came back to us, and I didn't get a particular answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make it <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
He finally agreed.
<unk> demand and they send me the information that I was <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little bit of brown brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 20 lines of information.
At the beginning, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a <unk> six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forward.
You can see every step I have.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> in train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other one, and the other one on the other, and we ended up with this great network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate with each other about what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the <unk>
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who sent him an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe would never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk>
Because today, state agencies and businesses want to store as much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to take it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home and tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not true of fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because businesses and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, and what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi sure, what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hi sure, what's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I put my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, by that <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, but they are.
It just happens by accidents, how I came to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- I don't want any of you to do.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you wish to be disabled.
Come ahead for you.
<unk> Christmas center, they're at the shopping center, drive in circles looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
They think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have the 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian and Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Jurassic Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three biggest sisters I would get <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would go to the public school, and they would stop that I was also -- and if not <unk> all the top note -- we all had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk over five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to take a dollar in front of me so that they would take it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and and and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion. which has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 ready, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot like dying of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell them that there was enough fat to live three months without eating, so we had the dawn of dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would become <unk>
On summer holiday often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to put me off in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the silver cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a stand-up comedian -- that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents would draw this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> the <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the <unk> I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and I took the <unk>
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> in order to have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end, I mean, at the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> I ran to the director of the theater department, crying in historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed I could not do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do stunt stunts you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role that was literally born and gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy, it.
The university was to do my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated home, and my first tour, and my first tour, it was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not white, with disability.
Just to tell people perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took a famous comics on New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led to when he was at the realization that it was at high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a driver who had cerebral palsy, with cerebral palsy, with the cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find a lot of fun.
In 2003, my mother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the New York City <unk> in New York, now on her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind the directors, of <unk> and <unk> and Arabic are <unk>
It was much easier to fight the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news program on the back with Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I was a graduate dance dance, I sat in a studio, and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So on top of me on the desk of the host to get out of the screen for the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
And I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but it never was <unk> of me or older than that.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do I <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite favorite -- a terrorist <unk>
What does it have?
We really should actually pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
Yet I had grown up with media media, I don't think that <unk>
I hope together we can create the most positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images that are less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> of the soap <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> at a representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give children refugee kids a little bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I do.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He ends up living in a tent outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- a year <unk>
One day he gets about a guy who offers him to take it to dinner, after dinner, after dinner with <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money so he bought new clothes, money to send home to her family.
They presented to a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That boy in that small village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in <unk> a terrorist organization that was connected with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village in a small town trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that took it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story repeats on urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, for well-being, but young people are engaging in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them any opportunities, the story of the <unk> the gate of access to terrorism, and violence -- being the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
Seventy percent don't work at school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "What if I never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support young leaders at a corporate kitchen.
<unk> about 90 <unk> young leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a college graduate college student, frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other Mexican organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer becomes, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for buses, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, its innovation actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to guide them in the development and put it out of their businesses.
We would give young people with the resources that they need to do, and we have support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Kansas Park is how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people into entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovative innovation and have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the <unk> a <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the sheets of <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be the way that we were able to pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> <unk> with about four square feet with apple hearts -- aluminum balls <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
And that question went with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> our trash -- <unk> of 11 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know us as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked around and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like garbage.
Now I wouldn't just travel in the trucks.
And they <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong, you get very quickly <unk>
It costs much to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continue to reduce the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Agriculture, <unk> <unk> is one of the ten <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're walking out and moving into traffic all day, and they fly around you.
You just want to <unk> so often the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And it's also <unk> it's filled with dangers that are often falling on the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the form of efficient and effective form of each day, this starts <unk> of its shipping and their dangers inherent in a very real way.
Because we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we have no space for what the engines of the economy begin to start to fail when it's in danger itself.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I'll just point out the relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average speed necessary.
And with that, I mean, just at the speed that we used to use to move in the time <unk>
We are usually not <unk> or <unk> or we get with our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water <unk>
We use, the <unk> forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will take care of it.
So today I will suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about harvesting waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keep us with ourselves from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I dropped the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank thank you to do this particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just say, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.
Shortly after that I started to investigate waste collection and I came back to see that guy.
It's called <unk> working together many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have in account every costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose job is to clean up the trash of you, take a moment to get it back.
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both of these projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in various floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen, because it's a temperate weather that's going from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what happens is nothing to do with Africa and not with Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile for a place to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure in the air that thousands of people -- they go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, and by applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to the CEOs the site, which is located in a very much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, linking all the entries from the building.
And it spreads out with a <unk> atrium, which creates a space in the air in the building that goes into its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes each floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would take to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air to the air -- and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that were not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what you get.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because they actually had more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have the air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is down almost every day.
So we get a great advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and the bars that would create this oasis of urban.
And these are <unk> on the roof, which has collected water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a <unk> <unk> master plan in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project as big, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen air gates connected by straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets -- creating 12 similar blocks similar in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the doors by straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation, was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate weather.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that ensures that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It's got these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And they also respond to local norms that make a greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving back to the community full of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and forth and make activity such as a <unk> race race per morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but let me improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good at <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I was to <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the high school, I was a little evening, and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took out of the table of my master's book <unk>
And then I did.
I put down the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some like that.
All of the things --  And I set up to bring the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put all the rows of <unk> and myself a row out of that, just because they were there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never told me.
But most of all, I would tell me the reason why I was bothered by this little girl so small, it was so good for <unk>
I get rid of jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children's murders in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would have been <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab where they study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> not a thousand and a <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
<unk> high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in terms of the <unk> I almost have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work <unk> "In the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and also <unk> <unk> my own, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to get to sleep <unk>
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how it's the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to someone else, their wish, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being the <unk> and <unk> we know exactly what details are going to do to <unk> the knife right?
<unk> do all novelists and <unk> and that's something that I was grateful for.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure might give birth to another, maybe now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> senses in their lover -- adds up to his collection of torture in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion of <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- links well <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> you hear behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, at what <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be, that makes us suffer, causes a range of much deeper feelings more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at properly intensity <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young young man who was being used by the idea that his wife would be.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or could be accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> really really described how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent and illegal acts of <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in the way entirely <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me here at 8 years, I'm going to get it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman from Michigan was captured by 52 years old was captured by having created fake account for Facebook since they were sent <unk> and awful messages to himself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his <unk> <unk> I have to tell you that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very weird and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try and how <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what is that it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to get ownership of your self and <unk> what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get your <unk> carrying your bank bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I sometimes wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in terms of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when you're on a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always said <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it with <unk> in each one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there's no one person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in the story. It looks like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute -- it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
All of a sudden, it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So while we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction fiction jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> the scary <unk> the terrifying of Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Aldrin jumped out of the module on Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence on the surface of the world was the culmination of a collective process, <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a quarter of 400,000 people and asked by 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died, including crew from Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which went after <unk> death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that President President wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the patient's own words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. So some people ask, why do I <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why will scale the most <unk> mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why would they fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice play against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not only a victory of the West about the East in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was about the wisdom of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew over 80 miles / hour hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful conversation about the power of technology has evaporated in the power of technology that we imagine technology would solve how to do Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube <unk> from the rocket Saturn V.
I knew vague that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I was going to see colonies on Mars.
So that's "Something's wrong with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like if the technologists had found us, and they've enriched trivial toys, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they are <unk> and Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that the venture capitalists are offered to the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas to be able to be able to be able to be able to create ideas for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the height of not worrying about risk, they preferred small investment, investment points where they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and which is that development is in the long term. They have never invested in the development of technologies that were intended to solve great problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve large problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption comes from renewable energy from solar energy -- the wind and the <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic control.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to have sources of alternative energy that can compete in price, don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international treaties are according to the development of an agricultural energy development, a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of today's political climate or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem like technology, turn out not to be.
We know for time that famines are result of failure in food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and systems for the storage of food, but there will be famines as a lot of governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes going to make a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon told him about the war in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer types, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can do and we need to be, but these four elements have to be <unk> and political leaders have to want to solve the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> it must really be a problem with it, and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, serving with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decline of trust, it's a very general belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should be <unk>
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It helps me to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen on others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion survey over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to inspiring the same distrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still quite <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through.
But this is what is enough?
What the opinion is recorded is, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at are generic generic attitudes, which people have been doing when you do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably said, "What for?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them but in other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel like a certain kind of a <unk> officer or a person or a person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all that knowledge when we think about trust <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to treat good judgment of the fact that they trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a blind goal.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would be able to get more confidence in what it's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who are saving their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> lying or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it that you say, yes, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
Which is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the raw materials and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, on the contrary, they're not responsible for them, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't stop in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will take your own competence of your own centers.
And I'm so happy to say that I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do before you trust.
Trust is the answer.
The point is what we need to care about.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build accountability accountability for all sorts of institutions, and officials and so forth, that they made us easier to judge trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, <unk> the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> which is going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will find that the accountability accountability of accountability is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we call them the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
It would take all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust and <unk> to people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people or officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things down.
It suggests that you and I should be reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in short, is defining because they give them a lovely number of people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to do the <unk> evidence of trust.
How do you do it?
That's every day, everywhere, the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks to tell you that I can do it without an explanations for.
I take them and get me back money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're going to witness is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust are in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when the other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers we have become <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone to become more and more and more and more, to such that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass display, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how it would be.
I first created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the display is the transfer of your physical body to <unk>
And designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands stay on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the <unk> Computer Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It was a transparent Norden bombsight with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and block the lines or the words with the <unk> sensor that is down on each floating screen.
architects can <unk> or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come to us?
And so many of us will have bought and process things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make some physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel alone.
This imam imam behave like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And to program the object, it will release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and so far, and that famous takes from Michael Jordan, can be played like a physical reality that we might be able to replicate it.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to understand ourselves from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you hit that barrier, the only limit it stays is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was invited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a <unk> path to <unk> a safe job and good job.
No matter if I want it or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera singer as well.
This was me in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never happen.
I would argue that for the rest of my life a second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
It would take the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the U.S. in 1995, and what were the first books that would be here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but odd ...
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It is so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are all to research camps like comparative comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, so why not do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in the same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> is economic and spiritual <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> the path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> way from the <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in translation, I found that you can gain a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling like powerless or ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I was not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a two-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex I walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office and grabbed the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy just to move your head while they were making the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I was saying Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after, you start to work on, you have children later, to death as well.
To pay for an Alex and I had time to have plenty of time.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> propelled me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, come out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they would do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex and a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this benign class was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and <unk> life but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million Americans.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think anybody gets to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> a <unk> -- I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the biggest truth matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years old.
It means that eight of every 10 and experiences and experiences and moments -- that give their life a long time when you have 30 and <unk>
People of more 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that you get.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up in the second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any point of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to get it on their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't listen to often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the players are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time to adulthood.
The researchers call <unk> a extended adolescence of <unk>
journalists named <unk> names.
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens at all.
And then every day, smart smart, interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, it's not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as I start a career before the 30, everything will be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are on <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They all running, but then at some point around the 30, the music turned out and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing that would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are you the ones here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but you don't know that the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the middle and so many of them start a career, to choose a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that starts to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful doing everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
He says you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the students are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because she was in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living with a very difficult time, his previous life was even more difficult.
They tend often in our sessions, but then she was getting up her -- "You don't pick her family, but he can choose to pick his friends."
Well, one day Emma got her head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had gone all the morning with his many <unk> but then she was watching the empty space that follows after <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of whether I was <unk>
At that point, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma went on.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that you get out of that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to his person.
Making something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> identity generates identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to do it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that should not count, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I would take jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with the very similar minds merely as they know what you know about, how do you think, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to go out of almost always comes from their closest circle.
<unk> things come from what they call weak ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or no work.
But the other half of it won't, and the weak ties are the way we get to this group.
The half of the work created never <unk> then, to know the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma will soon get her family when I have a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live in now, or now when everyone on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before they do it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're in the workplace.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it work or killing time with anyone who is <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of the airport in Los Angeles, and they go out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or 25 to the <unk> a good time -- a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, you get to identity and use their weak bonds pick your family.
Don't be defining by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them math to <unk> students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When the work came, you go down grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have credit I.Q.
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
Is it the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios. And in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy -- West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in the really hard neighborhoods -- and what teachers are still teaching for the end of school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results from their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, and what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, health care and it wasn't <unk>
It was determination.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires and then waited for about more than a year to see the people who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly increased <unk> even when they put them into every single characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> <unk> even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> where purpose. It's also in school, especially for children at risk.
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know about the science of the development.
Every day, parents ask me, "How do we develop determination for kids?
What should I do to teach children a good ethic.
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is talent doesn't make purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of individuals who are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, it's often not related or it's <unk> and it's even backwards to talent measurements.
So far the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not accurate that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to get <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have over the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try and start the whole new thing with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan, like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was reminded of this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks like the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new approach and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic saved 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read enough traffic signals from restaurants, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If you shape the fire is a person with arms on both sides, like if I were yelling at the way to <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe it's the other way. What it works.
This is a tree.
<unk> tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> on the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are a company, three are <unk>
If one person stretch out, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
Is it a field like <unk> inside the whale
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations
Walk a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is pretty <unk>
Remember the fire?
Two sides are very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Walk the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Get a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Did you have somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two together, they are <unk>
Three together, they have <unk> <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, they'll be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this eastern China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two <unk> stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind remind that I have to stop talking and go through the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we watched the magician of Oz together.
The movie was <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
And he gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic box.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children into a kind of industrial complex show of a child fantasy show.
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the last 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal kid and a boy named <unk> <unk> a girl in the enemy of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies were used by evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of the magician is that the most <unk> wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At the time, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  So she was struck in the room, and he was struck by a mom like a leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but he said, <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would it be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So the feeling that Luke is an army to take advantage of the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> of <unk>
How do Dorothy your film?
By doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be <unk> OK?
Why is there that so much force down degrees into the movies for our children, and so little on the road of bricks <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know because of the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected that the police start to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest has finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on beating the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, to defend the <unk> of Disney for any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, guys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how they defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear to appear at a classic one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend it. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let them get the <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to be <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not being roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had with a friend of mine on the assessment of the movies they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, in the film, there's more of a female character to have <unk>
So you have to get the <unk>
These women speak to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the guy's so <unk>   Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things together.
<unk> I've seen it, and I've rarely seen it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film movie.
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus about what a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't test the test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the land of the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and is the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So I went through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular films, how many of them do think they have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to go through this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said, this is what he said,
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of the mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that video videos or <unk> are closely <unk> but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do they do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is <unk> to <unk> with violence, and then they'll charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this <unk> <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our arrangement as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to do that, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children to a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role that you care about from the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of Star favorite books, and you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell me to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where he looked like his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better improve and become better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was transferred to <unk>
I began to see ways and patterns that helped me get to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length.
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Valley of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in plain sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like bright pink
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient city called <unk> -- lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Minister about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> of <unk>
This area is big, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as changed over time, he moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball gloves and using baseball.
So, we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of the <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists by doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry in the Middle Empire in the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that comes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but it will go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably was written in <unk> two years ago.
Now share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas were really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city, not for a long time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to the house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They're competing in a <unk> career and they're in the direction of their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
You have bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go on the wheels that end up in the wheels that end up in the <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate, <unk>
It is in the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light glows on the <unk> of <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
It was from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
You can feel your blue fur, making it on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> which is about to get into the mouth.
They went on one side and enter their living room.
It's already in the room, and doing peak their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over their <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to cooking.
The ground has been covered with a <unk> road path and from the oven.
OK, open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist would be waiting, I guess, I guess, this was like the end of a wise <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
Let me give entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize greater the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be known from nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This, is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to run these miracle acts of memory using a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that medieval scholars were used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English one, even a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk> <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live, on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went one afternoon, in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And in return, a number of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> memory -- and it was not one thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed.
It has changed, and I would say that they have changed a lot of <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of <unk> memory <unk> and grown is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> It's like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College invited a research group, to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control for the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI MRI machine, they put their brains while they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow. They found that in memory champions were <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
Actually they <unk> or looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The <unk> of <unk> competitive is driving as a armed race where each year, somebody comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a <unk>
In his desk, front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
About half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the way that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It shows it with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- I tell two people who remember the same word. I tell you about the same word. I'm going to tell you that there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his work is <unk>
Same word, different <unk> capacity that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean to you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories that dance on your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have flour in your hands.
They were good when they come home to work.
Would you probably get some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes from a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
I had hired him as entertainment, because I was like, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and as soon it was, the <unk> hall.
Let's get all of them.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies to <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
It could not be <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed eyes and realized that with her mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of the <unk> hand, where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers, or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If I told you that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be done to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who you were sitting on the horse menu in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that they want to remember. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- be the image, more <unk> to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that would have done it -- if you had been invited to be invited by 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And then come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous image -- crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition is completely <unk>
And then you can imagine walking into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> over Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'd see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote <unk> that you want to count.
And then they come in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help remember it.
So this is like speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his memory thumb.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something large about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk>
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing happens is when somebody got <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sitting in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about doing is better to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some of the golf glasses covered with tape just -- because the oxygen is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could enter in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I had to happen.
Now it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and it <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to put themselves into the memory of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a Catholic gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention to.
<unk> when we focus deeply up.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of attention processing that most of you are not going to lie down there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me that is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what we are already willing to lose in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks to our side, we are so <unk> that we didn't even understand ourselves to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would just be able to take a single place of <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there I all happened to see television on television. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody was coming to me, and every time I got married, and I would come back into one organism, everyone was there.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I hate that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about <unk> and it's about those <unk> emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we want.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to Climate Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
It determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell them, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it so based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century, to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing -- Russian brick columns, which leave you <unk> trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the <unk> the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, came another library, it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use communication media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So what is possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called the libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies new technology, new new solutions for today's life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so that we get completely away from the people.
And all of black, this is going to be interested in -- you think we are really good, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we all feel like <unk> we do <unk> we do <unk> the next 300 and over and over again, we've done this in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we were in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, large-scale scale.
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
Let's put this one again in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know that you like and <unk>
<unk> neon and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took closets <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The forms are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
nuts.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time on commercial centers, we moved into the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to <unk> or <unk>
Maybe maybe with a lot of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we visualize memories from other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started making it <unk> the one again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques in the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum will spend again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public critics in general, were fully agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> is this construction of <unk>
Tourism has increased in a half and a half percent when the building ended of the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, in Seattle, New York, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these and wild and radical shapes how it is possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media will spread around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same mayors did in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the early millennials happened with other architects star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take long to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if I designed it was a success or not.
Because there's never a good feedback on architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, it starts to become faster and faster, to be on both extremes in <unk> and it was effectively <unk> and effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can actually make a lot of symbols with an emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant two years before the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product, and it was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a middle of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by building these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media not only has changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first to the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there's no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and drawings and you are not a public audience, which is not accepts something that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the adjustment of one aspect to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in tomorrow will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in the basis of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will spread to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, too, can also serve for sport or <unk> or even one can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and then raise half a million dollars of the connected community around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings, more intelligent and more kind.
So we've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, to a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape it up to the more unequal spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very great, typical of the children of one year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it. And when stopped doing this?
How is it that we are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for this "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
What his mom says and her friends, or fellow school colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, who receives these answers in one of the stages of their increasingly vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it bringing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never done.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that is always connected to our children at <unk> based on the number of liking and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what's rigged it <unk>
What is the biggest thing in somebody's life, what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And they say, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare to.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the failed stars of the sport, and the singers who were <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their look, the price of every other aspect of their identity.
Things like your relationships, development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects begin to hurt.
Six of 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as taxpayers to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not attending at all in the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, if you don't think you see good enough, you know, if you don't think you're good enough, you take a lower note on the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it was independently of what these young people actually weigh about.
So, to be clear, we're talking about how you see it, not how you're actually like.
The <unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> healthcare.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they are in more less diet than they can take them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more skilled decisions like alcohol and drug consumption -- diet -- aesthetic relationships at ages early and without protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure in the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what is that <unk>
It is about interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there's a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children are not only going to have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, and the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone who are willing to provide an education on your body self-esteem that works.
A matter of education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
They challenging the status of the way women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you about the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
We can all begin by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can save people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's it the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their entire person, valuing about individuality, diversity <unk>
We need to put the people who actually make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them come out in the great screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be the ones that are the ones who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who are you in your mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
His name is <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is at two car seats, what it would mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he would give him a little bit of no longer legs. Get more skinny, a warmer belly or <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this, and we would make the potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are exported to us.
But let's go back to our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They put the self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And to work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become security agents of security themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November 5 in 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League Defense <unk>
They initially had been done by initially who was being naive, but being a prisoner on the other charges in the company of others, started planning on about 12 of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center could not get rid of them.
Later on, it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, a <unk> elementary school, between the two they made all possible for giving me happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims will meet.
So I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't need a lot to get to wish to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are going to become so <unk> to their convictions who think that we need to use all the possible media to everyone lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last week of week, he and some friends, they had been going to throw shot in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on her shoulder and explained how to point for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> I gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise everybody, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting one they're charged with 700 kilos of explosives in the northern parking lot of the World Trade Center and causing a explosion that killed six people and injured to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved at 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable with somebody else was time to pack up and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class, often it was a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I read it at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I haven't developed social skills, to put it very <unk> and to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'm <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they had to test my way to think, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we had done, was Jewish was to do.
I took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life was made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
Every life was taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, every gay was bad <unk>
I happened to be able to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and the least critical and less critical than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> by a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to deal with <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I was taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me become honest with my <unk> and he helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation or sexual orientation -- you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence on my own life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to hold on my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has been sufficient <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I go out and put myself at a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about taking the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better path to me, than even though I would join this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has had in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking against those acts without sense, as rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all.
Right now there is a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D, there's a <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your starvation, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of human truths to be human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, your own, you and you.
There's nothing to be able to do more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I'm not sure you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
The science, of science, is objective by nature, it is objective by nature.
<unk> for nature, is subjective subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, we will take that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is a studied brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations for.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of job of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problem with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> internal film.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how are they going to be <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how they work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we have <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here's the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a heart of my heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a string of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains some of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were going to be crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a fundamental <unk> space, space and mass.
We had fundamental laws which are <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
On the contrary, it considered principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, Maxwell discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, time, time, the basic laws of the <unk> and it applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find out with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, you know, fundamental ideas -- long, mass mass, and load, then in a matter of logic, you have to enjoy the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it suddenly is not that it is true of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the <unk> the <unk> of physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws just so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by the mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> may be full of distress when he thinks my God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some sense of feeling <unk> <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human, complex life.
<unk> of simple, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> by mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of integration integration of information, just quite significant, rather significant, very important.
But when you get to the pigs, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is minor -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will be a different level of consciousness of zero.
In fact, offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the <unk>
From <unk> vision can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is that he placed in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
So this vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a pretty serious social and ethical consequence.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, then it must be a vegan.
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think about it right, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in terms of ethical terms, and moral education, isn't so much the fact of consciousness, but its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> film.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated piece of information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems on the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of our <unk> our planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, we have a collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in one of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
And I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than a universal <unk>
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those thinking of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile a low education profile.
I went to school, I sat down with my friends, I had my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is one problem.
She's actually not accomplished <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, I had a long time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be known as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching school in a high school of <unk> just after 20 minutes in the class of 11 minutes -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking to them about <unk> law for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about things in school?"
They're usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disabled people like <unk> objects.
And we are. And it's not guilt of the boy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I was going to be doing what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell them, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to disability.
Yes, they've sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before we have <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without hands drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn -- you know, <unk> to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability at the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad than my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I have lost track of the number of times that have been <unk> strange to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability for people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by called the social model of disability that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common thing.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> say it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, you don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
And I'm here to get the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by something else.
And I know I am.
<unk> of other disabled people at the time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that get over,    -- the ingenious trick of how to load your battery on the cell phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our diagnostics, but against a world that we will <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stairs <unk> has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on front of a TV screen will not make the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live in where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> -- don't consider anything to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability than we are <unk> by up to the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade at a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you believe about to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game field at 160 <unk> blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> us trying to hold it out of all his self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So I had some videos to show you what the Google would use under the hull, you give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine coming up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment -- let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field of the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You guys want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players -- and you've asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take the next <unk>
We took this level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball in the bottom of the network? or <unk> by doing a <unk>
What will be their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> as a <unk>
Maybe it's <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's only virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the ultimate <unk>
It was augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief glimpse of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game, because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I put some radios on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player going back to your group, and you see your next move you show in front of you, in a plastic bar that you wear on it, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
And so they memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> strategy.
Augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in each corner of the stadium by having a view from the high people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It will also be for <unk> Who would have been <unk>
How would we be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
Let's take the ball and <unk>
They put on an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Typically, not <unk> but the system of the <unk> are <unk>
They go into the area of protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you were <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor can see when the receptor sees its bombsight as an area of grass that lights and can change the career.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public audience and fans have continued to move it from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You want to be in the field, you know.
They want to be your favorite player.
Augmented reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- as always, as we do.
Thank you.
I recently gave me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 in the middle of those 23 to me the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known as its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who was able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that each of it is released from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body goes against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down bones, some of which will be vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who will make this method of suicide tells the death of the death that is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel in parallel to bridge.
This is where most people have been before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darker time, it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year as this young man was talking with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had that day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal <unk>
And so we were able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of you who were born, but the officials as well.
We've been a long way since then.
Today, veterans were trained and psychologists train new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on the <unk> July last year by receiving a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a official <unk> bridge <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were actually flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> you never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity was more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and she left.
This guy's kind and intelligent boy from New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing too well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason they were asked by the order.
<unk> damage of suicide affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or a friend or someone loved it.
What do you do?
What is it about?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't want <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their lifetime, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to <unk> <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk about a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on October 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing who read the read.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home and talk about it to your friends who tell your friends, so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not really go back home.
Mike was driving up to San Francisco to see the <unk> party in the <unk> the 19 father of January.
It never got there.
I called the police police, and I called it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
One witness I had seen him jump from the bridge to <unk> at the afternoon of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a real heart disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 2005, I wrote a radio call for a suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I <unk> my bike.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and the next half after, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his account to come back to that day and give her life another chance.
When Kevin turned to the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he did, and you gave him hope and you gave her hope and <unk> life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You know, <unk>
You leave me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from a mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to take you up.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11 o'clock events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was paying for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
We would take Kevin when I only had six months -- completely unconscious of all of those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he says.
We give it thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes -- <unk> <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco Hospital at the night you're <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather gets stuck with a poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, robbery me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what the suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, would not think in hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Typically, this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and bird calls around the bridge.
The incidents of those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand on three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge, and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second they leave the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> in San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be used to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you focus on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I was finally able to do the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally set up with my inner truth with my inner truth with me.
And for complicated reasons, I will go over later when I look at this picture, and I think we got it, you got it, you know, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> limitations or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my Hollywood agent, ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this shirt on his head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair.
I knew how to <unk>
Gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that it's actually something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I thought it will be bad, but why the world is treating those of us who want to <unk>
Every day, I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines in the Philippines of these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up with me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you engaged in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and he got off that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and she was third <unk> between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was <unk> of beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that they passed my request from the green card that could go to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you go to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand make the more sophisticated surgery, sophisticated and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before they changed the name of the name and gender.
So, in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> was living his truth, but he <unk> her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 o'clock in November we do a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who are <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my real truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
They'll you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you -- thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk>
And my support network, my parents especially, in my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been in young women who have <unk> and some times, when I was called and they told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, and I took my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work -- others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that homework doesn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of wealthy and tribal societies that are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign in education defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, by <unk> the National Committee <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality and exploitation.
You see, in the industrialized societies right from the very beginning, when when they're born a little girl, his birth will not be saved.
It's not welcome or his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood goes, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to get a little girl.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he was born, his third daughter, daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter was just <unk> when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it was home and the school was home to her brothers.
Up to age 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you know, the one is a part of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of the code of honor, doesn't just affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl with a very humble and very <unk>
Is it the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and it accepts their father decisions and mother and decisions and even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if he <unk> it with an old man, she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this cycle of vicious goes down and continues.
He took brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a fascinated of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so that he was for her.
But when I was born, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, and when she was four and a half years and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
So you might be wondering, why should I mention the entrance.
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of a Canadian Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
They encouraged them to go with different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on his personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
He took brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete complete denial of engagement in all political, economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and raised through the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, she offered her himself for the New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October October 2012, 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love my wife and <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never meet.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to get it right. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when they didn't have his homework.
They fight his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring that has done so bold to <unk> as brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I mean, I didn't know.
I didn't cut your wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I have joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Are you running out of intelligent or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, whether if it didn't take anything, would die within hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to follow life.
More than one time I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to get the <unk> dose, because there's really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to test with different mixes and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose changed to my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I tried a little dose and chemical <unk> for a man aged 1900s, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts changed my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was having a lot of fun to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to <unk> I've been better at men.
What I was trying to do when we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think almost always in images, and that became my key point for the key reference point of how those images I use to create <unk> my ideas -- if you were going to have new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who are taking this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to thinking of thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> actually <unk> very well rather sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to get this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments made by two groups that were done in neuroscience.
Both of these used technology we used an image of functional MRI to represent the brain. Here you can see brain scanning by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The context of the brain shows the scanning of the brain that same individual is being <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine to see that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from a <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they would get rid of their brains to create a great pool of reactions to the video sequences of video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as we become a new <unk>
And the computer, using only the brain information on the scan of the scan -- to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew up <unk>
We're pretty close to getting there.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution to scale up as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is to open up the skull and put my electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, including me, with the recent result of the <unk> first, we must ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets <unk> but at this point, they just offer small improvements at the resolution of not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> magnets made better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the orphanage, and often <unk> FM in the MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field they are able to reduce magnetic patterns structured <unk> to the radio radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the radio processing patterns of radio radio processing -- we can increase a massive form of information that can be taken into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity that the direct neural activity is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few choices to open this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I will talk to you this night about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe to tell some person for the first time he loves it, or tell somebody who's pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for which you have in life.
All I come up with is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived in and out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's <unk> and we don't like to happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through a number of phases of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope by the <unk> of my short pants and so I got my head up, I was a little bit of a child, "Hey, you're like, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And there would be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father of <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother was a cold, looking at his son.
But I would not say anything, and we go into it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
The quotes of Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deeper and I went down and I went down to my back, and I got a little black girl with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're guy or <unk>
So I took a big breath again again, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a <unk>
I have the short hair like this guy, and I saw clothes clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl of a pajamas.
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. They just go, "Oh, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation for everybody I've ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some lines in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color they are.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why to go out of my closet that was harder to go out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has <unk> in banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me this story that I tell is harder to tell your five-year-old who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop to classify what is difficult to make it difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our craft, and we should only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what the walls made of your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, which had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> <unk>
I wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any four year-old boy who would go out to the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark universe, <unk> my gay grenade and the moving only one muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family my friends, full strangers that I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill.
One of my most memorable grenade launches was at my sister wedding.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady in my black dress and she walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to make me years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I grew up with Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> Do you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, Will Grace and Grace
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at the time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how the hard conversations are still getting my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three of the Girl 2: <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it means to come out of anything, is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be true.
<unk> <unk> <unk> yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't see yet, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be straight right -- just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and number three,  Let the complex.
You can communicate your truth.
It will never be bothered by that.
And some of you can get wounded safe, so they have done, but it's never close to what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark <unk> I get a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be seen.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a <unk> criticism of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we set up a program to try to understand the fundamental core mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the Earth or the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know about this, which has no concept of intelligence on Earth would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that would take the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different subjects and <unk> together, I said, for several years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> F, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a force -- with the diversity of possible future futures accessible, Yeah, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Your intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom freedom and keep the options open.
And so having in account this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Is it the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection will be between entropy and <unk> intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system in any system where you find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence -- to play games, and even make a lot of <unk> money, and they would have no idea to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
It simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for humanoid robotics and human <unk> technologies.
This tool use of tools will have applications will have applications of smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release food, and we see that we can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> linking new connections into a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps successful the network well connected.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of an boats, discovering successfully and using Panama Panama to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated actions, in a simulated actions, growing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have vast applications in finance, safe and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all of us from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in it.
Machines will spread against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they try and try to take over the world.
It's all the other time that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than the other way.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets are going to be <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom freedom and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the empowerment of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when planets go over in front of them, and they block some light to go.
The data gathered by Kepler show the size of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
At this time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure treasure trove of worlds we have our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was record.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have <unk> rapidly our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a science scientist or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where we discover the life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, shown this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, is because we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> trace their surface into search of clues to the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites as the <unk> mission is taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, we have remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain by <unk> places that are really compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement is about the colonization of Mars and other planets will go to a big and sad realization that the implication and the belief that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like to think about me, I'm deep to disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to make humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the <unk> party will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in place in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked asked to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life evidence to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we have this development.
It's <unk> to think that just <unk> colonization we will save us themselves, but the planetary preserving and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to apply to the organic environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see by the window that they were at the dining table in the dining table where I had them <unk>
So quickly he tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all well closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I could not go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I was very cool.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate, reduce heart levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours <unk>
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, and systems that could put in place that I would think there was bad things.
Or at least if you're going on bad things -- that you will give you the chance that it's a total catastrophe, happen.
So I started thinking about it, but until one month my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and he had forgotten my passport. And Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this one few years before, known as <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come up and tries to figure out what was wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you go ahead and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is of some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
In the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds <unk> and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the right thing is, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes are going to be living in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they made the sense of <unk> of the <unk> and still could find her nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook on the door, with the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for you.
For your reading reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they are <unk> with that stuff whenever you get them out there.
What about <unk>
Take with your cell phone, a picture of your credit card license, passport, <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can ease the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that it would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most intractable drugs in the world today, and it's even likely that you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you need to ask for the majority of doctors don't want to talk about, and companies have even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not guilt. And if it's somebody's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they can help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
Same thing <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now maybe you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not do it -- <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody else.
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, let's take the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced on five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the <unk> string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that help you help the drug.
I don't say they needed or not to take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you have to have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is a part of the beginning of informed consent of informed consent of it.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery, it gets more done in the older men in 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case, produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this stuff in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Working with a predator with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, not very quickly. You could get lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have shown.
So we have to figure out to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how those are <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent things in the first place.
I went on the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key door to the gate of the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> That's my favorite musical symbol there.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be fully silent.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the story of the American American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the early 1800s, and over the time, it mixed with local feedback, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true at all.
Sound is a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, continue to blindly <unk> their rules, provide behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise at eating the bag of chips <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is for coming next.
Out of this drawing.
We decide.
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, doing it with my thumb doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic meeting there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it going to tell me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound -- I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get back to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to help me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, it's like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> her voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value in something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with the sound as my new artistic medium is <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and to fully express the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into many different <unk> parameters.
If you are mapping a different parameter for each finger as the facial expression, the body -- the facial expression, the body -- the speed, the shape of hand and so while you play the piano, English is a linear language, as if you put it down just a key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a <unk> concept of <unk>
If only one key to change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the gravitational signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through <unk> lenses.
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you get it, and you get the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to you, tonight."
tonight."
This is all night, at this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And let's go tonight."
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how long the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to save you a long time.
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> at the same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it over again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take away again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they transmit very different meanings themselves.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very pristine world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have this sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what the social value defines and allow us to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take your ears, open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can fix everything, but then you have to get it out.
Freedom is a responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also asking me, and they're not very good for cleaning the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we get the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it were, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to actually study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we would take this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge <unk>
So together with my students, six to 15 to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job with <unk> and so the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are feeling great, secure and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just collecting information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
Then we quickly created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we would transform light lights, and you put it into a floating robot that will slowly move around the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture that's captured by the robot.
We look at plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step by step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to do it immediately.
I wanted to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news news, <unk> the Internet, and you get involved with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest largest <unk>
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is coming in, the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also of brown color and when everything gets together, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra -- which can help identify what's in the water.
We made this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the remote shape other children.
I was forced to look at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe I could address a more difficult problem, and I was also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half -- and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that there was several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the east of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power plant nearby to water.
And today, according to the average 300 metric tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is disappeared from the <unk> coast and the most, of course, has safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and worked independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not <unk> parents didn't get it.
But every night we reported to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different masks on here.
It might seem like they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> your entire life.
Along with them, we discussed the data on that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> we started to represent real-time data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear central to date.
We are approaching up to a miles of the nuclear plant, and with the help of fishermen from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space between social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal -- chemistry, a little bit of biology, in lens, basically, can be built almost entirely there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the child dreams can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked them things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the age of age, transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the one of a single silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One <unk> on the environment, he believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest unit of life, cells, we have all the information required by every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and manufacturing production.
The assembly lines have been <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> from different parts of different functions.
But you can't find <unk> material in the wild.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts mainly as a filter, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> <unk> of every designer and an architect in the work now between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world -- my left hemisphere and the right, and <unk> is shown in both screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, it's about bringing these two visions of the world, moving out of the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they have four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created it.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that some day is not very far from printing buildings, and graphics at the nanoscale made from genetically <unk> <unk> <unk> in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each aperture is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion whatsoever, with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator of 3D printing we print this layer and 3D <unk> no seams between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner.
What designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, which is a chair at the comfortable situation, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my <unk> went back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We would take this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not using the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continually <unk>
But it is nature <unk>
There's no parts of nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a broken tree, <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, floating leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was an <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with <unk> cortex, water and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of <unk>
Would you have a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material that was <unk> the kind of material of the tree collected with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons -- produce every year by organisms as shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their <unk> we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call this legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark and <unk> and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made from one single 3.5 <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it up to you to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that showed up for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> <unk> bacteria designed rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh -- and if it broadens it even more.
A small tree comes <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> put in the sea, and they will put on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
So <unk> for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the ability to create clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table of elements of new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid objects, just rather than <unk> metals -- <unk> -- new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We had our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second -- E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that relates to the tract tract that will help you flow through these bacteria and make it <unk> their function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body -- we will make the properties of material that is according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This <unk> system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our <unk> <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are early <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that are <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, I linking those fibers to each other.
And this happens by scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the architecture of cocoon of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm into a flat patch not within a box, we realized that they would take a cocoon and cocoon of <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the shape -- the composition, the <unk> structure are transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> its silk <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the <unk> <unk> without boiling a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms will spread into more dark and darker areas -- so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and heat, spreading the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to get away with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
And the biological silk of the silk <unk> <unk> they give all this room the integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is through a <unk> arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us to form a two of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to an inspired design in nature that is inspired by design, which demands for us, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the arts and websites -- and then he was playing the guitar on a gang band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist in anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of, this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I went down to something else, something completely different, and I get involved in it, and I'm going to get <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me is not <unk>
I was really concerned about being afraid of engagement, or to be bathed or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and all these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we are about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make beautiful answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is about and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to pick in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of exercise.
Why?
Now, if this question inspires kids to dream with what might be, I'm not inspired by dream of everything you might be.
In fact, it just does the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, while adult <unk> may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and he <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The point of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real word, the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of creative interests.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms, that you can take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance time, the ideal was that it was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> you should be able to beat.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
There are three superpowers in there.
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, by <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel was occurred to him this unique idea of his <unk> <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is rapid learning.
When we <unk> we <unk> we get into it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because they were a lot of times in the past, and this means we're less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new zone that we are rarely <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child pianist asked an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known thing.
Before it become a writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the earliest sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That means the ability to transform into anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of the videos, so many pages of web pages, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, and sometimes James James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs -- the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, but we need creative thinkers right now, and we need creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> of belly knowing whether they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in practical practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and race careers with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part would be told that it simply become more like your fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell you with your many passions.
Keep curious about those <unk> <unk>
At the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a happier and happy life.
And perhaps most important -- <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> brought her to a psychiatric psychiatric person.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, he was done a look at a look at a look at it and found weird plate and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
And even more surprising.
If you were to have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has been a lot of progress.
It has been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections, a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But in 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two of two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their years to be Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's dollars costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the world's <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death of all the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but all of the industrialized world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, all the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to releasing a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can be large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what driving is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in his most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, reinventing <unk> physical, engineers, engineers, mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms -- on the other hand, have protein molecules that strike each of them, like human Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we use it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have discussed more research and <unk> pressure on governments, and industry industry and <unk>
That was essential to move through HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved day, day and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most of the cases of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were going to talk about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I posted this article in the New York Times column in January <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when we tested it myself as a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will be <unk> to get 36 questions, more and more personal and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would tell another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> I really want to tell your partner what you like to or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave you things that you wouldn't say you you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me, the gadget of two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we would tell us and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spinal column -- a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, they follow even worse.
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because you've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published that article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and figured out that my article in the New York Times reaches probably a few thousands of view.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I didn't have any idea.
The paper ran on a Friday night, and on a Saturday, this was on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the "Today Show me and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper received over eight million <unk> and I was like, just prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with each other's experiences -- but another thing is to discover that <unk> life has been international news --  -- and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were going to ask the same question: Still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers were <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> your own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to have any request that we were both to do a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and I would take the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons in the <unk> of the process of <unk> a range of that I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really do -- I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just a adventure, but real love, <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, above all, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we were to put it together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997.
Instead, he was looking for interpersonal approach, among college students, using college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But study does work.
The participants were felt closer to the rest of the way after doing it, several later protocol -- they also used <unk> protocol as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community. And they have used it among people of opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and it didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, you want to say that you love the person with whom you do it.
Well, he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to get the research <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult splitting of it.
I'd had that relationship since I was 20, which was mostly my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I was thinking about science.
And so I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be able to get the heart of the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if they built me with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I come for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for, is sometimes more than that you can demand me.
And so I'm looking for love is an assurance -- not just being loved today, and to be <unk> I just want to keep in love with the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether they were still together.
The story was told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate the <unk> risk and this is a very scary story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And its content with a reply to yes or No.
So more than a question, I want to ask you questions more hard questions, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more popular conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's a <unk> a year ago, a well-known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my favorite paper, love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no thought of all that choice anymore.
It didn't seem to have a lot of times we'd have both of that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to be done, and it responded to 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of kind and kind and kind and <unk> and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what I'm going to do, and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian in broad mountain, and I sort of arrived like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York is a while.  Something that really affected me but more detail later.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
So I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> or a few aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it is <unk> because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and all of those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I went to the Agnes <unk> I covered the <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, what happened is the opposite of the opposite: I somehow seemed like that <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did I build more boxes.
This time, I started to add pieces of electronic elements, and there was weird bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
And I can flow from you, drawing just like you do about a dead <unk> a crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I mean, you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool. man.
At some point I got interested in human form, it was <unk> of resin of <unk> with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass wall, similar to the drawing on a window, then on other window and another window, and he had all these windows together and they formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was very big, which I call <unk>
<unk> inspired me largely in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It's got double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is where the animals with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, some kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That is the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, a bird, and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> a tail of snake attached to the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made from 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
All of his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be fair, dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of <unk> file, they travel in groups, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human human in its inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest.
I'm going to accompany you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming out.
There's a little <unk> scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you be <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that I live in.
And together we get to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, in borders, of religion, not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has made against pain, first happens by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill to be the most effective and <unk> system for any drug to be able to make a matter effect on the body.
The disadvantage -- though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve the amount of viruses in blood and increase the <unk>
But they are also known for their side side effects on its most negative, because in time that it takes to get to the current stream -- they get <unk> and worse still for the time they take it to their fate, which is where it's most important, in the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of the treatment, viruses can wake up and infect new cells cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a life treatment for life run by.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the storage store without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it to be used to care of wounds and surgery, it can be used for anything else, including <unk> transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce your medications.
The best people are saying, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of laser beam into the cellular membrane infected by HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drugs.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or in <unk> and the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device from three heads.
With the first head, it's our laser, we'll do a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it moves to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> that distributes it directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher investigator in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to <unk> not violent.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how do they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the <unk> policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking out.
It would make a complex machine of <unk> radio channels, and Internet channels, web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the printed <unk> magazine in English and printed to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising but using <unk> businesses for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do also do something else they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run professional training programs or professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state doesn't deserve safe and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan -- the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to get security security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high <unk> cost.
But in general, social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of Hamas <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex setting, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps protected by government, and emerge as armed groups are involved in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the more sophisticated these are these organizations, we are less able to do it as something to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory run all its function, collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, with no state and hybrids and the weaker the ones are states, like the Middle East in the Middle East and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the state of not security.
We would have that vacuum of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and to build peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will better understand what incentives offer to encourage the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but not give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill up that vacuum vacuum to fill that empty governance that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist player.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but it's pretty bad.
And so I got a bad feminist guy.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The bad <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call <unk> <unk>
So what started like a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take you one step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sex. How if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, they ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and he can't imagine being another person.
By the time, as I became growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They have the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy way to use and accessible contraceptives and services for them.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and so much more.
We need to have in account these differences and how we behave the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad name.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and a offends me, the classic <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my musical expression.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of junk and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies about the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for judgment.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I don't have that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it causes women to be economically vulnerable when they're <unk>
Let's have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has been ignored or rates, historically the needs of women of color women -- gay workers, and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> <unk>
If that's good, feminism is a very bad feminist feminist thing.
It's also the following: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be able to adapt it to perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is meant to fear not being able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like me, call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music ranks of 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show <unk> seeing this pop star will hug the feminism and to know the women and the young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments if <unk> was or not exactly a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
They are perfection by the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to be much beyond the sane <unk> and <unk> feminism Feminism is the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more well, feminism feminism is a <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> to the action and be a little more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy that they would provide a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make it that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> and brilliant girls and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
Where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think about them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we listen to songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies do not treat women more than <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow classmates, they are <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, to participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also force ourselves to be included until more as we are trying to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power directors, and music producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant.
We can also tell the courage our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you about everything, because the ancient my voice was a stolen one, and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A couple of guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might really matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me, and understood what meant living in this world if you have brown skin <unk>
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if it was a bit brave another woman might be <unk> and see me and realize that none of us is the whole thing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And on the other, I hold the fictional reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, we had measles children in California had measles to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border of Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that are <unk> from this outbreak is that measles that can be terrible for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for over half a century over half a century, but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by British Medical <unk>
They don't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children with autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their entire career without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were only stable only three or four children per 10 or four children per capita.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
funds of fundraising funds as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if you could put it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what do you do?
If you ask people to the Centers for Centers for Disease Disease Disease what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnostic and a better detection <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to face her two year-old child contact with visual contact.
If the <unk> criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is it has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science than the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around them, even to their own parents.
They could amuse him for hours by shaking their hands on their faces, but they were prey on the <unk> of <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, I declared to see less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as it was <unk> references from as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 kids sent by other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of psychotic child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell you about 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents who were desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, and I thought the theory of mothers in <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as a <unk> consumer services, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their fellow families, and his colleague Judith Gould who decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw left clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit on <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted it.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of the data.
So how did no one ever benefit from these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided the <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, <unk> husband was spoken German, and he was translated it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> which I ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for the <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the children kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, as their young teachers, and he took them to help in the development of methods of education that were especially suited for them.
<unk> has seen autism like a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in biblical culture known in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there until I mean, for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive model.
These changes not fell into <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> acting as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four Nobel <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first successful clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they hoped that they were hoping that the people with autism and their families will finally raise their support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in diagnostics. A simple, powerful story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the preventing center that one from 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's correct, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have joined the Internet on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving the new doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is not working with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards -- the normal human brain is easily <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to details.
Indeed, people are autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
